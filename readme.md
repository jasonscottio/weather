Weather Forecast
===================




Description
-------------
This web app was built for my Frontend JavaScript course at Lernia. This is the final project for the introductory course to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It utilizes Boostrap 3, jQuery, jQuery UI, and the Apixu weather API. 


----------




Design Process
-------------

For this project I utilized a "mobile first" design process. I began designing the site focusing on a small iPhone 5 screen size and then built up to 4k desktop resolutions. The mobile first design utilizes both Bootstrap's built-in responsive framework as well as custom media queries. The custom query breakpoints are at 375, 450, 768, and 1200 pixel widths. I focused on my content rather than common device widths for finding my breakpoints.

	 - Autocomplete functionality using jQuery UI autocomplete.

	 - Font sizes of panel content change as resolution increases.
